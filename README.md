Hello!

This is a small learning project to get more comfortable working in unity, and relearning c# and coding generelly. 

There's not much complex made here, but it looks very soothing to play!

Wish you enjoy my little 2d topdown demo, with a tilemap generator and character that has a runspeed on dexterity!

Cheers! Kind regards fungus.
